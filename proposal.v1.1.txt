 Proposal for quiltpad project
 
 1.  The quiltpad application is a basic paint program that makes a quilt block which is 
 segemented into triangles, squares and rectangles which are coloured using grey scale values 
 (light, medium, dark).  The quilt block is then replicated to create a full quilt.  
 The application also lists the size and number of each specific-shaped piece required 
 to make the quilt.
 
 2. Classes:
	   Quilt
	   Block
	   Piece	   	
	
 3. Attributes for each class:
 
	Quilt:
		blkQty
		vBlkNo
		hBlkNo
		qHeight
		qWidth
		
	Block:
		name
		uniquePieceQty
		blkSize
 
    	Piece:
	   	type (sqr, rect, halfTri, quartTri)
	   	value (light, medium, dark)
		position
		vSideLength
		hSideLength
		aSideLength
	   	bSideLength
	   	cSideLength
	   	value 
	  	qtyPerBlk
	   
 4. Use Cases:
	a) Replicate block to fill in specified quilt grid (i.e 4 by 3 quilt)
	b) Calculate the number and size for each different fabric piece (i.e. shape,
	      size and value) required to make full quilt.
