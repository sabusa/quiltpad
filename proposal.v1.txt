 Proposal for quiltpad project
 
 1.  The quiltpad application is a basic paint program that makes a quilt block 
 using triangles, squares and rectangles which are coloured using grey scale values 
 (light, medium, dark).  The quilt block is then replicated to create a full quilt.  
 The application also lists the size and number of each specific-shaped piece required 
 to make the quilt.
 
 2. Classes:	
	   Quilt
	   QuiltBlock
	   Triangle
	   Rectangle(includes square)
	
	
 3. Attributes for each class:
 
	Quilt:
		blockQty
		verticalBlockNo
		horizontalBlockNo
		quiltHeight
		quiltWidth
		
	QuiltBlock:
		name
		uniquePieceQty
		blockHeight
		blockWidth
 
    Triangle:
	   type (i.e. halfSquare, quarterSquare)
	   aSideSize
	   bSideSize
	   cSideSize
	   value 
	   qtyPerBlock
	   
	Rectangle:
	   type (i.e. rectangle, square)
	   height
	   width
	   value
	   qtyPerBlock
	   
 4. Use Cases:
       a) Replicate block to fill in specified quilt grid (i.e 4 by 3 quilt)
	   b) Calculate the number and size for each different fabric piece (i.e. shape,
	      size and value) required to make full quilt.
